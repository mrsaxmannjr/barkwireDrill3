## Barkwire Pairs

In this drill, you're going to pair up with a partner to knock out a story for BarkWire Pairs, a dating app for dogs.

## List Dogs

You have the ability to look at a list of dogs at `http://localhost:3000/dogs`, and any individual dog at `http://localhost:3000/dogs/:id`, but you can't add a dog at `http://localhost:3000/dogs/new`.

You need to:

* Make a form with inputs for `name`, `profile-picture` and `bio`, as well as a submit button.
* On submit, turn the form data into a JSON string with the keys `name`, `profilePicture`, and `bio`, and `POST` it to `http://localhost:3000/api/dogs`
* When the form finishes submitting, redirect the user to the dogs list
